# minecraft_datapack
THis is my first minecraft data pack, I am testing out some things that I can do using Bolt/Beet.

Some of the code in here are from previously testing around with a tutorial made by Big Papi Gaming on youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/@bigpapigaming1126)
This project is more or so made from a modpack that I created for my friends server, and something for me as well. And lot of parts of the code was helped using AI (ChatGPT), however the AI always kept messing up the code. so I had to fix a big chunk of it.
One of my current ideas that I have with the funny Super Sonic transformation is highly inspired by SonicRushXII (https://www.youtube.com/@sonicrushXII), and his amazing datapack creations.

This datpack is only for me, and I will not be distributing it to anywhere else. Only leaving it here in the GitHub using it as a form of portfolio or smth.

Anyways have a good day if you're reading this!
